## Setup and execution steps

    npm install
    npx cypress open

## Cypress config

- I set the `baseUrl` to `https://automationteststore.com/` to avoid repeating the domain in every test.
  This allows us to use relative URLs with `cy.visit()` and keeps the test code cleaner and more maintainable.

- I used the `defaultCommandTimeout: 8000` setting to make Cypress wait up to 8 seconds for individual DOM elements or asynchronous operations to become available.
  This helps ensure more reliable testing in cases where elements load dynamically.

## Test files

- [homework_12.cy.js](cypress/e2e/homework_12.cy.js):
  The file contains automated E2E tests that verify product sorting, cart functionality, category count, and registration form validation.
  These tests cover key user flows, such as checking Aâ€“Z sorting, calculating cart totals, ensuring the presence of 7 product categories, and validating form error handling.

- [guestCheckoutFlow.cy.js](cypress/e2e/guestCheckoutFlow.cy.js):
  The file contains an end-to-end test that simulates a complete guest purchase flow.
  It verifies product search, review visibility, cart and checkout steps, guest payment without login, and accuracy of order details on the invoice page.
